👋 Hi! I'm Kristofer Tsai, a Computer Science student at UCLA with a passion for data science and artificial intelligence. 
- With past experience in machine learning, analytics, and applied AI, I am interested in creating impactful projects through data science.

🌟 Professional Highlights:
- GovTech (Singapore): Contributed to the development of Singapore’s first **Artificial Intelligence Playbook** and explored the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.
- Bruin Sports Analytics: Analysed the relationship between driving distance and scoring performance on the PGA Tour using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, refining statistical models for predictive insights.
- rideOS: Leveraged machine learning to predict NBA game outcomes using Python and WEKA, experimenting with classifiers like Naïve Bayes, J48, and K-nearest neighbours.
- Singapore Mint: Assisted with data digitisation, audits, and market research to enhance operations for minting circulation coins.

📁 Projects:
- [PGA Tour Analytics](---): Explored key performance metrics and modelled trends using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to drive actionable insights.
- [NBA Game Outcome Predictor](---): Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict NBA game results, extracting data via API and experimenting with multiple classifiers.
- [Formula 1 Design Optimisation](---): Applied aerodynamic principles (fluid dynamics, thrust, drag, lift) to optimise F1 car performance, achieving 2nd place overall in a competition.

🔧 Technical Skills:
- Languages & Tools: Python, C#, C, SQL, WEKA, CAD, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Certifications: Google Data Analytics, Unity Junior Programmer
- Spoken Languages: English (Native), Chinese (Native), Japanese (Beginner)

🌱 Currently Learning:
- AI classifier optimisation, management, and deployment strategies for scalable machine learning models.

🤝 Looking to Collaborate On:
- AI-driven/data analysis projects, sports performance modelling

⚡ Fun Fact:
- I once completed an entire sports data science project to prove to myself that I was playing golf wrong. (Spoiler: I was!)
